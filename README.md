This is a Hackathon Web Challenge 

The main aim it to create a mortgage calculator app using ai tools for automation and a bit of HTML, CSS and javascript , a bit of json.

For code review i have used a bit of Chatgpt, Copilot, Bolt AI builder and my Stack Overflow.

I have decided to build the the web frontend using AI tools e.g. Chatgpt then mainly builder.io which then connects to my Github account.

The changes made on my builder.io side can be pushed to Githug directly.

The site is deployed on netlify with the link here : https://sbkwebhackathon.netlify.app/

And as someone once told me "As long as it works , don't touch it"
